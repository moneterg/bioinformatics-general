# 🧬 My Bioinformatics Notes & Tools

This repository is a personal collection of scripts, notes, and mini-projects I developed during my work as a bioinformatician. It includes useful command-line snippets, data processing tools, and documentation related to tasks I encountered in genomics (and other omics also), sequencing, and data analysis.

🚧 **Note:** This repository is a work in progress and will be updated gradually as I organize and share more of my previous work.

💬 I share this content to help anyone who, like me, spent years feeling a bit lost in this sea of information.

🌱 To future bioinformaticians:  
Don't give up, even when things feel uncertain.  
Stay curious and be persistent.  
And never forget to read (with attention 😊), learn, and study (always).

✨ Over the years, it has often been difficult to receive proper credit for many of the contributions I've made. Perhaps because I am a woman, recognition wasn't always fairly given.
After nearly a decade of work, I've decided to share this repository with my notes in order to support others openly and generously.  
If any part of it helps you, I’d be truly grateful if you mention it.
Your acknowledgment means a lot.

💪 This repository is the result of years of study, countless hours of hard work, and real sweat!
🔓 So that none of it would stay hidden any longer.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or get inspired by the resources here.
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 😊💬🤝
